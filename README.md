This R script includes processed data, and generates graphs associated with            
the manuscript "How tree species, tree size and topographical location influenced      
tree transpiration in northern boreal forests during the historic 2018 drought"

SAP FLOW DATA PROCESS:                                                                        
 - Sap flow method used: Heat dissipation. Granier 1985
 - All data was corrected by wounding drigt, using newly installed sap flow sensors
 - Sap flow was estimated for each tree, using radial profile equations, fitted every 30 minutes

WHOLE-TREE CONDUCTANCE METHOD:                                                          
 - Phillips & Oren, 1998
 - Whole tree transpiration was divided over Dz (mean VPD, normalized for daylength)
